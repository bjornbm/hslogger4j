Introduction
============
Hslogger4j provides handlers for hslogger[1] (John Goerzen's Haskell
logging library) that are compatible with log4j's XMLLayout. In
particular log messages created by the handlers can be published
directly to the GUI-based log viewer Chainsaw v2[2].

The set of log levels in hslogger is richer than the basic set of
log4j levels. Two sets of handlers are provided with hslogger4j,
one which produces logs with hslogger's levels and one which "demotes"
them to the basic log4j levels. If full hslogger levels are used
some Java installation is necessary to make Chainsaw aware of them.

Usage of the handlers in hslogger4j is analoguous to usage of the
'StreamHandler' and 'FileHandler' in 'System.Log.Handler.Simple'.
The following handlers are provided:

  - log4jStreamHandler  (hslogger levels)
  - log4jFileHandler    (hslogger levels)
  - log4jStreamHandler' (log4j levels)
  - log4jFileHandler'   (log4j levels)


Installation
============
Haskell
-------
Use the regular cabal process:

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

Java
----
This is only necessary if you want to use the hslogger levels.

Add 'hslogger4j.jar' to your classpath. To use you will also need
to have the jars 'log4j-1.3alpha-7.jar' and 'log4j-xml-1.3alpha-7.jar'
that are distributed with Chainsaw on your classpath.

(On Mac OS X I added all three jars to '~/Library/Java/Extensions'.
It seems that it is not sufficient that Chainsaw already includes
its jars in the classpath when launching -- perhaps the plugin
classloader does not inherit Chainsaw's classpath. Adding the jars
to '~/.chainsaw/plugins' wouldn't work either.)

If for whatever reason you have to rebuild the hslogger4j jar just
run 'ant'[3]. The new jar will be created in the 'dist/lib' directory.


Usage
=====
Haskell
-------
In the IO monad:

> lh2 <- log4jFileHandler "log.xml" DEBUG
> updateGlobalLogger rootLoggerName (addHandler lh2)

> h  <- connectTo "localhost" (PortNumber 4448)
> lh <- log4jStreamHandler h NOTICE
> updateGlobalLogger rootLoggerName (addHandler lh)

Chainsaw
--------
If you are only using the basic log4j levels just use Chainsaw's
regular facilities to browse logs or listen for log messages
(XMLSocketReceiver).

If you want to use the hslogger levels the easiest way to set up
Chainsaw is to load the plugins in 'hslogger4j-plugins.xml' when
launching Chainsaw. Two receivers will be defined, one that listens
for logmessages and one for reading log files. Edit the properties
of those receivers as needed (e.g. port, file name) and restart
them.
